# Codecademy_Python3 Readme
## About Me
My name is John. I'm using this Github repository as part of my self-guided journey toward coding proficiency. 
I'm currently focused on Python 3 and SQL for analyzing data from business systems.

I'm still very new to coding and the associated tooling, so please 
don't hesitate to share tips, advice, and guidance.

## About This Repository
I'll be posting here primarily for code review. If you've been invited to participate, it's probably because
we interacted in a Codecademy forum.
